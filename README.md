# face mask detection using yolo

The current Covid-19 outbreak is still serious and the need to wear a mask in public has become common knowledge. The main route of transmission of novel coronavirus is droplet transmission, and wearing a mask can effectively block the spread of the virus. Masks are an important line of defense against respiratory infections and can reduce the risk of novel coronavirus infection. However, there are always people around us who do not like to wear masks, whether in public places such as shopping malls, classrooms, streets, underground parking lots, or in crowded conference rooms, they do not like the "restraint" of masks. YOLO (You only look once) is one of the fastest object detection algorithms that enables real-time detection. We will use YOLO v3 [1] to detect facial masks. Using the mask detection model trained by YOLO v3, it will be possible to find in real time exactly who is wearing a mask, who is not, and who is not wearing a mask correctly. This can be done as a spot reminder or to stop people from entering or leaving public places without wearing masks properly, saving manpower and significantly increasing efficiency.
